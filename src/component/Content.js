            How is AR steel made?
          </h2>
          <h5 className='text2'>Carbon is a key alloy for increasing the hardness of abrasion-resistant steels â€“ but too much carbon reduces its tensile strength and toughness, making it brittle and vulnerable to cracking. Additional AR steel alloys include manganese, chrome, nickel, and boron in different proportions based on specific end-use goals of the wear-resistant grade.

            As hardness increases in traditional AR steels, their formability and weldability decrease, limiting their applications. But the toughness of our abrasion-resistant steels lets fabricators bend, form, and weld without losing its properties, making it suitable for more challenging applications.
