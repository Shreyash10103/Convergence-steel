                Inserts or indexable inserts are used as the cutting edges for cutting tools such as tool holders for turning and face milling cutting for milling.



                The insert geometry, tolerance, dimesions, and terminology are all based on the ISO standards. Other countries such as America (ANSI) and Japan (JIS, CIS) have their own standards but they are all based on the ISO standards.
                Mechanical inserts are commonly used in construction and manufacturing processes to provide threaded holes in materials where it may not be feasible or practical to tap threads directly. These inserts can be made from various materials such as steel, brass, or stainless steel, and they come in different designs to suit different applications.

          <p>Inserts are classified as two general types: those held in place by external threads and those that use some means other than threads (knurls, grooves, interference fit) for their holding power.Externally threaded inserts can be further divided into three types: </p><p>
            <ul>
              <li>Wire-thread inserts: These precision coils of diamond-shaped stainless wire form both internal and external threads. They are screwed into pretapped holes to provide an accurate standard internal thread for screws, bolts, or studs. </li><li>Solid self-tapping/self-threading inserts: These thread-cutting or thread-forming external threads are for use in either drilled or cored holes. Thread-cutting types have thread interruptions on the external threads in the form of slots or holes to provide cutting edges similar to a tap. Thread-forming types have external threads shaped in a series of lobes to form threads in the base material. Self-threading types create no chips. </li>
              <li>Solid bushing: These inserts use a number of locking techniques to match most situations. One version has built-in locking keys that are driven in after the insert is in place to provide rotation resistance. Other two-piece inserts have a separate key ring or serrated locking ring to provide the torsional resistance. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>Threaded insert</h3>
          <p>A threaded insert, also known as a threaded bushing, is a fastener element that is inserted into an object to add a threaded hole. They may be used to repair a stripped threaded hole, provide a durable threaded hole in a soft material, place a thread on a material too thin to accept it, mold or cast threads into a work piece thereby eliminating a machining operation, or simplify changeover from unified to metric threads or vice versa.</p>
          <p>Mechanical inserts are specially designed threaded inserts that are installed into materials like metal, plastic, or wood to allow repeated assembly/disassembly with bolts or screws. Some key things about mechanical inserts:<br /><br />
            <ul><li>They provide reusable and replaceable threaded holes in materials that are too soft or weak to tap threads directly.</li>

              <li>Common types are helical coil inserts and threaded metal bushings. They are installed by drilling a hole and screwing or pressing them in.<br /></li>
              <li>
                The inserts are made of hardened metals like steel or brass so they can withstand repeated use without wearing out.<br /></li>
              <li>
                They distribute load and grip better than tapping soft material directly, providing stronger threaded holes.<br />
              </li><li>
                Using inserts prevents threading soft materials like aluminum or plastics repeatedly, which damages the threads.
                <br /></li>
              <li>
                Inserts allow a standard threaded hole to be created in materials too thin or brittle to tap directly.</li><li>They come in a wide range of thread sizes and types to match various bolts and applications.

                <li> Mechanical inserts act as reusable threaded bushings that protect soft parent materials from damage while providing reliable threaded holes for assembling components.</li><li> They are a convenient way to create standardized, robust threaded holes in otherwise fragile materials.</li></li></ul>
